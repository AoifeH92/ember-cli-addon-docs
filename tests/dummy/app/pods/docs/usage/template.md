# Usage

## Requirements

To use AddonDocs, your addon must have a `devDependency` of **Ember v2.8** or higher.

Note that your addon can still support older versions of Ember – it's just that you won't be able to run your AddonDocs documentation site against those older versions. (This means you also cannot write acceptance/application tests against your docs sites on older versions of Ember.)


## Installation

```sh
ember install ember-cli-addon-docs
```
